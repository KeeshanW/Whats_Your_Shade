# Whats Your Shade?

Hey, What's Your Shade?

Technology Utilized: Python | Pandas | Numpy | Matplotlib | SQL | Seaborn | Beautiful Soup | Open CV | Google CoLabs | Scikit Learn | MediaPipe

This project identifies faces in an image and determines regions within the face that are indicative of skin color. Once identified, the pixel values for these regions of the face are pooled and extracted, its color determined in RGB color space and then compared to a database of makeup foundation shades to identify the closest match.
